This is the third school project, wich builds on the second school project.

The additional coding was built with Visual Studio Code by usin Javascript.

This is a simple site of my CV with several pages having my contacts and about me, there's on the homepage several projekts, the first projekt being the simple login-page i made. 
The other project cards are simple placeholder for future project to be placed in.

Haven't put much info about me, but that will change later in time. For now there is lorem ipsum to act as placeholder.

Have coded in functions into the main page like a slideshow so you can slide through the project cards with help  of the buttons to their sides, and also added a hidden easter egg that pops up a modal.
